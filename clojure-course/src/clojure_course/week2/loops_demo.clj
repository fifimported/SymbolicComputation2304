; remember, "y" points to some object in memory.
; If you print "y", you will see something like "object...". This is Java toString() method.
; to get value of atom, use "@" symbol
(while (>= @y 0)
  (println "y=" @y)

  ; on the atom standing on the first position
  ; it is the same as (dec @y)

; two vectors declared

; let's loop via one vector
(for [just_a_variable vector1

; let's loop two vectors: one inside another
; it works like loop inside another loop
; like this:
; for i=0;i < 10; i++
; for j=0;j < 10; j++

(for [var_from_vector1 vector1
      var_from_vector2 vector2
      ]
  ; it creates and prints small vectors of two values: the first one is taken from vector1, the second one -- from vector2.
  ; as usual, it iterates inner loop (vector2) for each value from outer loop (vector1)
  (println [var_from_vector1 var_from_vector2])
  )

; another way to iterate
(doseq [var_for_iteration vector1]
  ; do something
  (println "var_for_iteration=" var_for_iteration)
