One day, Mr. Furball became interested in how many grandfathers and grandmothers he had. Mr. Furball has a mother and father, and each of them has a mother and father as well. And so on, and so on.
Let's say a baby is born in a typical cat family when both parents are three years old.
Please use recursion and calculate how many cat grandfathers and grandmothers Mr. Furball had for 100 years.
